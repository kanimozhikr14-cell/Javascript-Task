var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned. 
let is block-scoped and can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope. const is also block-scoped but cannot be redeclared or reassigned, so it is used for fixed values.

var allows redeclaration and it is function-scoped, JavaScript does not treat redeclaration as an error.
Both var and let allow reinitialization, meaning their values can be changed after declaration.
const does not allow redeclaration or reinitialization. Once a value is assigned to a const variable it cannot be change
const ensures that the value remains constant throughout the program.
Redeclaring a let variable in the same scope causes a syntax error, because JavaScript does not allow multiple declarations of let.
Reassigning const variables causes type error because it cannot be modified.
const is preferred because it enforces block scope and prevents unintended reassignment, making code more reliable and easier to maintain.
No, const cannot be declared without initialization. JavaScript requires a value to be assigned at the time of declaration, otherwise it throws a SyntaxError.
var  should be avoided because its behavior can cause unexpected bugs. Let and const provide better control and are safer alternatives.

SyntaxError - let does not allow redeclaration
Type error - const variables cannot be reassigned after initialization.
var a = 10;
var a = 20;
console.log(a);
let b = 5;
b = 15;
console.log(b);
const a = 12;
a = 24;
	This causes TypeError because constvariable cannot be redeclared.



var count = 1;
count = 2;
let count = 1;
count = 2;
Value changes here and this place is applicable.
var a = 15;
Const a = 15;
var Name =”Kani”; //can be redeclared or reinitialized
let age=”35”;  //can be reinitialised
const gender = “Female” //can't be changed.
